# electron-transparent-window

Very simple Electron starter template modified from my [electron-shell](https://github.com/clubside/electron-shell) project.

## Features

- `main.js` to launch the app and store and retrieve user preferences with window position and size.
- Context menu that works on input elements and can open `DevTools` and quit the app.
- IPC function to open links in user default browser.
- `preload.js` to populate tool version information and link browser to main process.
- `index.html` is a simple full window display using styles including a background image from a different folder.
- transparent, frameless and no menu. Hamburger menu for dragging and other window functions.
